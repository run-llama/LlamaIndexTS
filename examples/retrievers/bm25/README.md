# BM25 Retriever

In this guide, we introduce a bm25 retriever that search documents using the bm25 method. BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function that extends TF-IDF by considering term frequency saturation and document length. BM25 effectively ranks documents based on query term occurrence and rarity across the corpus.

## Setup

1. `cd` Into the `examples` directory
2. run `npm i`

## Example

```bash
`npx tsx ./retrievers/bm25/example.ts`
```
