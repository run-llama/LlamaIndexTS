# Qdrant Vector Store Example

How to run `examples/qdrantdb/preFilters.ts`:

Add your OpenAI API Key into a file called `.env` in the parent folder of this directory. It should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-you-key
```

Now, open a new terminal window and inside `examples`, run `npx tsx qdrantdb/preFilters.ts`.

## Notes

- You should have a Qdrant instance running locally.
