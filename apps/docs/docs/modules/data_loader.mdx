# Loader

Before you can start indexing your documents, you need to load them into memory.

### SimpleDirectoryReader

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/examples/readers?file=src/simple-directory-reader.ts&title=Simple%20Directory%20Reader)

LlamaIndex.TS supports easy loading of files from folders using the `SimpleDirectoryReader` class.

It is a simple reader that reads all files from a directory and its subdirectories.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource}</CodeBlock>

Currently, it supports reading `.csv`, `.docx`, `.html`, `.md` and `.pdf` files,
but support for other file types is planned.

Also, you can provide a `defaultReader` as a fallback for files with unsupported extensions.
Or pass new readers for `fileExtToReader` to support more file types.

<CodeBlock language="ts" showLineNumbers metastring="{8-12,17-21}">
  {CodeSource2}
</CodeBlock>
