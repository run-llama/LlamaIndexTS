# Loader

Before you can start indexing your documents, you need to load them into memory.

### SimpleDirectoryReader

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/examples/readers?file=src/simple-directory-reader.ts&title=Simple%20Directory%20Reader)

LlamaIndex.TS supports easy loading of files from folders using the `SimpleDirectoryReader` class.

It is a simple reader that reads all files from a directory and its subdirectories.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource}</CodeBlock>

Currently, it supports reading `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.htm`, `.html`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` and `.gif` files, but support for other file types is planned.

You can override the default reader for all file types, inlcuding unsupported ones, with the `overrideReader` option.
Additionally, you can override the default reader for specific file types or add support for additional file types with the `fileExtToReader` option.
Also, you can provide a `defaultReader` as a fallback for files with unsupported extensions. By default it is `TextFileReader`.

SimpleDirectoryReader supports up to 9 concurrent requests. Use the `numWorkers` option to set the number of concurrent requests. By default it runs in sequential mode, i.e. set to 1.

### LlamaParse

LlamaParse is an API created by LlamaIndex to efficiently parse files, e.g. it's great at converting PDF tables into markdown.

To use it, first login and get an API key from https://cloud.llamaindex.ai. Make sure to store the key as `apiKey` parameter or in the environment variable `LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY`.

Then, you can use the `LlamaParseReader` class to local files and convert them into a parsed document that can be used by LlamaIndex.
See [LlamaParseReader.ts](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/blob/main/packages/core/src/readers/LlamaParseReader.ts#L6) for a list of supported file types:

Additional options can be set with the `LlamaParseReader` constructor:

- `resultType` can be set to `markdown`, `text` or `.json`. Defaults to `text`
- `language` primarly helps with OCR recognition. Defaults to `en`. See [../readers/type.ts](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/blob/main/packages/core/src/readers/type.ts#L20) for a list of supported languages.
- `parsingInstructions` can help with complicated document structures. See this [LlamaIndex Blog Post](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/launching-the-first-genai-native-document-parsing-platform) for an example.
- `skipDiagonalText` set to true to ignore diagonal text.
- `invalidateCache` set to true to ignore the LlamaCloud cache. All document are kept in cache for 48hours after the job was completed to avoid processing the same document twice. Can be useful for testing when trying to re-parse the same document with, e.g. different `parsingInstructions`.
- `gpt4oMode` set to true to use GPT-4o to extract content.
- `gpt4oApiKey` set the GPT-4o API key. Optional. Lowers the cost of parsing by using your own API key. Your OpenAI account will be charged. Can also be set in the environment variable `LLAMA_CLOUD_GPT4O_API_KEY`.
- `numWorkers` as in the python version, is set in `SimpleDirectoryReader`. Default is 1.
