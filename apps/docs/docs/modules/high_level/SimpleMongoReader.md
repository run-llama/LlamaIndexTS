To use the `SimpleMongoReader`, you first need to import it from the `llamaindex` package. You also need to import the `MongoClient` from the `mongodb` package. 

Next, create an instance of `MongoClient` with your MongoDB URI as the argument. 

Finally, create an instance of `SimpleMongoReader` by passing the `MongoClient` instance as an argument.

## Methods

The `SimpleMongoReader` class has a single method, `loadData`.

### loadData

This method is used to load data from a MongoDB collection. It takes the following parameters:

- `db_name`: The name of the database to load.
- `collection_name`: The name of the collection to load.
- `max_docs` (optional): Maximum number of documents to return. 0 means no limit.
- `query_dict` (optional): Specific query, as specified by MongoDB Node.js documentation.
- `query_options` (optional): Specific query options, as specified by MongoDB Node.js documentation.
- `projection` (optional): Projection options, as specified by MongoDB Node.js documentation.

The method returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `Document` instances.

```typescript
To load data from a MongoDB collection, call the `loadData` method on the `SimpleMongoReader` instance. 

This method takes two arguments: the name of the database and the name of the collection. 

It returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `Document` instances. You can handle this Promise using the `.then()` method and log the documents to the console, for example.
