# Loader

Before you can start indexing your documents, you need to load them into memory.

## SimpleDirectoryReader

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/examples/readers?file=src/simple-directory-reader.ts&title=Simple%20Directory%20Reader)

LlamaIndex.TS supports easy loading of files from folders using the `SimpleDirectoryReader` class.

It is a simple reader that reads all files from a directory and its subdirectories.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{CodeSource}</CodeBlock>

Currently, it supports reading `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.htm`, `.html`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` and `.gif` files, but support for other file types is planned.

You can modify the reader three different ways:

- `overrideReader` overrides the reader for all file types, including unsupported ones.
- `fileExtToReader` maps a reader to a specific file type. Can override reader for existing file types or add support for new file types.
- `defaultReader` sets a fallback reader for files with unsupported extensions. By default it is `TextFileReader`.

SimpleDirectoryReader supports up to 9 concurrent requests. Use the `numWorkers` option to set the number of concurrent requests. By default it runs in sequential mode, i.e. set to 1.

### Example

<CodeBlock language="ts" showLineNumbers metastring="{8-12,17-21}">
  {CodeSource2}
</CodeBlock>
