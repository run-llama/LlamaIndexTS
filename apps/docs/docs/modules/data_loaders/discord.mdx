# DiscordReader

DiscordReader is a simple data loader that reads all messages in a given Discord channel and returns them as Document objects.
It uses the [@discordjs/rest](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/main/packages/rest) library to fetch the messages.

## Usage

First step is to create a Discord Application and generating a bot token. You can do that [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
In your Discord Application, go to the `OAuth2` tab and generate an invite URL by selecting `bot` and `Read Messages/View Channels` as wells as `Read Message History` bot permissions.
This will invite the bot with the necessary permissions to read messages.
Copy the URL in your browser and select the server you want your bot to join.
