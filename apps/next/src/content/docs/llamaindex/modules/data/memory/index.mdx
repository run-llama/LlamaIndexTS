## Concept

Memory is a core component of agentic systems. It allows you to store and retrieve information from the past.

In LlamaIndexTS, you can create memory by using the `createMemory` function. This function will return a `Memory` object, which you can then use to store and retrieve information.

As the agent runs, it will make calls to `add()` to store information, and `get()` to retrieve information. 

## Usage

A `Memory` object has both short-term memory (i.e. a FIFO queue of messages) and optionally long-term memory (i.e. extracting information over time).

`get()` always returns all messages stored in the memory. The longer the agent runs, this will exceed the context window of the agent. To avoid this, the agent is using the `getLLM` method to get the last X messages that fit into the context window.

### Configuring Memory for an Agent

Here we're creating a memory with a static block (read more about [memory blocks](#long-term-memory)) that contains some information about the user.

```ts twoslash
import { openai } from "@llamaindex/openai";
import { agent } from "@llamaindex/workflow";
import { createMemory, staticBlock } from "llamaindex";

const llm = openai({ model: "gpt-4.1-mini" });

// Create memory with predefined context
const memory = createMemory({
  memoryBlocks: [
    staticBlock({
      content:
        "The user is a software engineer who loves TypeScript and LlamaIndex.",
    }),
  ],
});

// Create an agent with the memory
const workflow = agent({
  name: "assistant",
  llm,
  memory,
});

const result = await workflow.run("What is my name?");
console.log("Response:", result.data.result);
```

### Using Vercel format

You can also put messages in Vercel format directly to the memory:

```ts
await memory.add({
  id: "1",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  role: "user",
  content: "Hello!",
  options: {
    parts: [
      {
        type: "file",
        data: "base64...",
        mimeType: "image/png",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

If you call `get`, messages are usually retrieved in the LlamaIndexTS format (type `ChatMessage`). If you specify the `type` parameter using `get`, you can return the messages in different formats. E.g.: using `type: "vercel"`, you can return the messages in Vercel format:

```ts
const messages = await memory.get({ type: "vercel" });
console.log(messages);
```

## Customizing Memory

### Short-Term Memory

The `Memory` object will store all the messages that are added to the `Memory` object. Unless you call `clear()`, no messages are removed from the memory. This is the short-term memory (usually you will store the memory of one user session there) which is augmented by the long-term memory.

Calling `getLLM` will retrieve messages from long-term memory and ensure that the given `tokenLimit` is not reached. These are the messages that you will sent to the LLM.

For initialization, you call `createMemory` with the following options:

- `tokenLimit`: Maximum tokens for memory retrieval using `getLLM` (default: 30000).
- `shortTermTokenLimitRatio`: Ratio of tokens for short-term vs long-term memory (default: 0.7)
- `customAdapters`: Custom message adapters for different message formats. LlamaIndex (`ChatMessageAdapter`) and Vercel (`VercelMessageAdapter`) are built-in adapters.
- `memoryBlocks`: Memory blocks for long-term storage, see [Long-Term Memory](#long-term-memory)

Example:

```ts
const memory = createMemory({
    tokenLimit=40000,
    shortTermTokenLimitRatio=0.5,
});
```

### Long-Term Memory

Long-term memory is represented as `Memory Block` objects. These objects contain information that are from previous user sessions or from the beginning of the current conversation. When memory is retrieved (by calling `getLLM`), the short-term and long-term memories are merged together within the given `tokenLimit`. 

Currently, there are two predefined memory blocks:

- `staticBlock`: A memory block that stores a static piece of information.
- `factExtractionBlock`: A memory block that extracts facts from the chat history.

This sounds a bit complicated, but it's actually quite simple. Let's look at an example:

```ts
import { createMemory, factExtractionBlock, staticBlock } from "llamaindex";

const memoryBlocks= [
  staticBlock({
    id: "core_info",
    content: "My name is Logan, and I live in Saskatoon. I work at LlamaIndex.",
  }),
  factExtractionBlock({
    id: "user-extracted_info",
    priority: 1,
    llm: llm,
    maxFacts: 50,
  }),
];
```

Here, we've setup two memory blocks:

- `core_info`: A static memory block that stores some core information about the user. This information will always be inserted into the memory. The type used is `MessageContent` to support multi-modal content.
- `extracted_info`: An extracted memory block that will extract information from the chat history. Here we've passed in the `llm` to use to extract facts from the chat history, and set the `maxFacts` to 50. If the number of extracted facts exceeds this limit, the `maxFacts` will be automatically summarized and reduced to leave room for new information.

You'll also notice that we've set the `priority` for the `factExtractionBlock` block. This is used to determine the handling when the memory blocks content (i.e. long-term memory) + short-term memory exceeds the token limit on the `Memory` object.

- `priority=0`: This block will always be kept in memory (`staticBlocks` always have priority 0.)
- `priority=1, 2, 3, etc`: This determines the order in which memory blocks are truncated when the memory exceeds the token limit, to help the overall short-term memory + long-term memory content be less than or equal to the `tokenLimit`.

Now, let's pass these blocks into the `createMemory` function:

```ts
const memory = createMemory({
  tokenLimit: 40000,
  memoryBlocks: memoryBlocks,
)
```

When memory is retrieved (using `getLLM`), the short-term and long-term memories are merged together. The `Memory` object will ensure that the short-term memory + long-term memory content is less than or equal to the `tokenLimit`. If it is longer, messages are retrieved in the following order:

1. StaticMemoryBlock (information always included)
2. LongTermMemoryBlock (depending on priority)
3. ShortTermMemoryBlock 
4. Transient messages

The amount of short-term memory included is specified by the `shortTermTokenLimitRatio`. If it's set to `0.7`, 70% of the `tokenLimit` is used for short-term memory (not including the static memory block).

## Persistence with Snapshots

Save and restore memory state:

```ts twoslash
import { createMemory, loadMemory } from "llamaindex";

const memory = createMemory();

// Add some messages
await memory.add({ role: "user", content: "Hello!" });

// Create snapshot
const snapshot = memory.snapshot();

// Later, restore from the snapshot
const restoredMemory = loadMemory(snapshot);
```
