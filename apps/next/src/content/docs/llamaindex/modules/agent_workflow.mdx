Agent Workflows are a powerful system that enables you to create and orchestrate one or multiple agents with tools to perform specific tasks. It's built on top of the base `Workflow` system and provides a streamlined interface for agent interactions.

## Usage

### Single Agent Workflow

The simplest use case is creating a single agent with specific tools. Here's an example of creating an assistant that tells jokes:

```typescript
import { agent, FunctionTool } from "llamaindex";
import { OpenAI } from "@llamaindex/openai";

// Define a joke-telling tool
const jokeTool = FunctionTool.from(
  () => "Baby Llama is called cria",
  {
    name: "joke",
    description: "Use this tool to get a joke",
  }
);

// Create an single agent workflow with the tool
const workflow = agent({
  tools: [jokeTool],
  llm: new OpenAI({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  }),
});

// Run the workflow
const result = await workflow.run("Tell me something funny");
console.log(result); // Baby Llama is called cria
```

### Event Streaming

Agent Workflows provide a unified interface for event streaming, making it easy to track and respond to different events during execution:

```typescript
import { AgentToolCall, AgentStream } from "llamaindex";

// Get the workflow execution context
const context = workflow.run("Tell me something funny");

// Stream and handle events
for await (const event of context) {
  if (event instanceof AgentToolCall) {
    console.log(`Tool being called: ${event.data.toolName}`);
  }
  if (event instanceof AgentStream) {
    process.stdout.write(event.data.delta);
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow

An Agent Workflow can orchestrate multiple agents, enabling complex interactions and task handoffs. Each agent in a multi-agent workflow requires:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the agent
- `description`: Purpose description used for task routing
- `tools`: Array of tools the agent can use
- `canHandoffTo` (optional): Array of agent names or agent instances that this agent can delegate tasks to

Here's an example of a multi-agent system that combines joke-telling and weather information:

```typescript
import { multiAgent, agent, FunctionTool } from "llamaindex";
import { OpenAI } from "@llamaindex/openai";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create a weather agent
const weatherAgent = agent({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  description: "Provides weather information for any city",
  tools: [
    FunctionTool.from(
      ({ city }: { city: string }) => `The weather in ${city} is sunny`,
      {
        name: "fetchWeather",
        description: "Get weather information for a city",
        parameters: z.object({
          city: z.string(),
        }),
      }
    ),
  ],
  llm: new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o-mini" }),
});

// Create a joke-telling agent
const jokeAgent = agent({
  name: "JokeAgent",
  description: "Tells jokes and funny stories",
  tools: [jokeTool], // Using the joke tool defined earlier
  llm: new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o-mini" }),
  canHandoffTo: [weatherAgent], // Can hand off to the weather agent
});

// Create the multi-agent workflow
const workflow = multiAgent({
  agents: [jokeAgent, weatherAgent],
  rootAgent: jokeAgent, // Start with the joke agent
});

// Run the workflow
const result = await workflow.run(
  "Give me a morning greeting with a joke and the weather in San Francisco"
);
```

The workflow will coordinate between agents, allowing them to handle different aspects of the request and hand off tasks when appropriate.
