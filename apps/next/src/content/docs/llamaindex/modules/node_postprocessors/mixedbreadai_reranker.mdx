## Setup

First, you will need to install the `llamaindex` package.

```bash
pnpm install llamaindex
```

Next, sign up for an API key at [mixedbread.ai](https://mixedbread.ai/). Once you have your API key, you can import the necessary modules and create a new instance of the `MixedbreadAIReranker` class.

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@llamaindex/openai";
import { MixedbreadAIReranker } from "@llamaindex/mixedbread";
import { Document, Settings, VectorStoreIndex } from "llamaindex";
```

## Usage with LlamaIndex

This section will guide you through integrating mixedbread's reranker with LlamaIndex.

### Step 1: Load and Index Documents

For this example, we will use a single document. In a real-world scenario, you would have multiple documents to index, like a variety of breads in a bakery.

```ts
const document = new Document({
  text: "This is a sample document.",
  id_: "sampleDoc",
});

Settings.llm = new OpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature: 0.1 });

const index = await VectorStoreIndex.fromDocuments([document]);
```

### Step 2: Increase Similarity TopK

The default value for `similarityTopK` is 2, which means only the most similar document will be returned. To get more results, like picking a variety of fresh breads, you can increase the value of `similarityTopK`.

```ts
const retriever = index.asRetriever({
  similarityTopK: 5,
});
```

### Step 3: Create a MixedbreadAIReranker Instance

Create a new instance of the `MixedbreadAIReranker` class.

```ts
const nodePostprocessor = new MixedbreadAIReranker({
  apiKey: "<MIXEDBREAD_API_KEY>",
  topN: 4,
});
```

### Step 4: Create a Query Engine

Combine the retriever and node postprocessor to create a query engine. This setup ensures that your queries are processed and reranked to provide the best results, like arranging the bread in the order of freshness and quality.

```ts
const queryEngine = index.asQueryEngine({
  retriever,
  nodePostprocessors: [nodePostprocessor],
});

// Log the response
const response = await queryEngine.query("Where did the author grow up?");
console.log(response);
```

With mixedbread's Reranker, you're all set to serve up the most relevant and well-ordered results, just like a skilled baker arranging their best breads for eager customers. Enjoy the perfect blend of technology and culinary delight!
