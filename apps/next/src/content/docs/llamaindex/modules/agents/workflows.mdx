title: Workflows
---

A `Workflow` in LlamaIndex is a lightweight, event-driven abstraction used to chain together several events. Workflows are made up of `handlers`, with each one responsible for processing specific event types and emitting new events.

Workflows are designed to be flexible and can be used to build agents, RAG flows, extraction flows, or anything else you want to implement.

To use workflows install this package:

```package-install
npm i @llamaindex/workflow
```

This package is a stable, production-ready version of our [llama-flow](/docs/llamaflow) project. 

While you can still reference the llama-flow documentation for detailed information about the underlying concepts, we recommend using the `@llamaindex/workflow` package for all new projects to ensure stability and long-term availability.
