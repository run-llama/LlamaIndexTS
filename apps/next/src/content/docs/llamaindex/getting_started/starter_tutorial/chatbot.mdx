Once you've mastered basic [retrieval-augment generation](retrieval_augmented_generation) you may want to create an interface to chat with your data. You can do this step-by-step, but we recommend getting started quickly using `create-llama`.

## Using create-llama

`create-llama` is a powerful but easy to use command-line tool that generates a working, full-stack web application that allows you to chat with your data. You can learn more about it on [the `create-llama` README page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-llama).

Run it once and it will ask you a series of questions about the kind of application you want to generate. Then you can customize your application to suit your use-case. To get started, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npx create-llama@latest
```

Once your app is generated, `cd` into your app directory and run

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

to start the development server. You can then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app, which should look something like this:
