We have a comprehensive, step-by-step [guide to building agents in LlamaIndex.TS](../../guides/agents/setup) that we recommend to learn what agents are and how to build them for production. But building a basic agent is simple:

## Set up

In a new folder:

```bash npm2yarn
npm init
npm install -D typescript @types/node
```

## Run agent

Create the file `example.ts`. This code will:

- Create two tools for use by the agent:
  - A `sumNumbers` tool that adds two numbers
  - A `divideNumbers` tool that divides numbers
-
- Give an example of the data structure we wish to generate
- Prompt the LLM with instructions and the example, plus a sample transcript

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={CodeSource} />

To run the code:

```bash
npx tsx example.ts
```

You should expect output something like:

```
{
  content: 'The sum of 5 + 5 is 10. When you divide 10 by 2, you get 5.',
  role: 'assistant',
  options: {}
}
Done
```
