Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Why mention Vite?

Vite.js is widely used in building many web applications, like React.js, even for some native app like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

However, it's not a ready-to-use solution for a Node.js-like application using Vite, as Vite is designed for web applications(run in browser).

There's some plugin/framework based on Vite, like [Waku.gg](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku), or [Electron Vite](https://electron-vite.org/)

For now, we have no clear solution for bundling LlamaIndex.TS with Vite, if you have any idea/solution, please let us know.
