import { ChatDemo } from '../../../../components/demo/chat/normal';
import { ChatDemoRSC } from '../../../../components/demo/chat/rsc';

Using [chat-ui](https://github.com/run-llama/chat-ui), it's easy to add a chat interface to your LlamaIndexTS application.
You just need to create an API route that provides an `api/chat` endpoint and a chat component to consume the API.

## API route

As an example, this is an API route for the Next.js App Router. Copy the following code into your `app/api/chat/route.ts` file to get started:

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./src/app/api/chat/route.ts",
	"codeblock": true
}
```

## Chat UI

This is the simplest way to add a chat interface to your application. Copy the following code into your application to consume the API:

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./src/components/demo/chat/normal.tsx",
	"codeblock": true
}
```

## Try it out ⬇️

Combining both, you're getting a fully functional chat interface:

<ChatDemo />

## Using with Vercel AI RSC

You can use chat-ui with Vercel AI RSC easily. Here's an example:

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./src/components/demo/chat/rsc/index.tsx",
	"codeblock": true
}
```

<ChatDemoRSC />

## Next Steps

The steps above are the bare minimum to get a chat interface working. From here, you can go two ways:

1. Use [create-llama](https://github.com/run-llama/create-llama) to scaffold a new LlamaIndexTS project including complex API routes and chat interfaces or
2. Learn more about [chat-ui](https://github.com/run-llama/chat-ui) and [LlamaIndexTS](https://github.com/run-llama/llamaindex-ts) to customize the chat interface and API routes to your needs.
