Before you start, make sure you have try LlamaIndex.TS in Node.js to make sure you understand the basics.

Also, you need have the basic understanding of <a href='https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/'><SiCloudflareworkers className="inline mr-2" color="#F38020" />Cloudflare Worker</a>.

## Adding environment variables

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const { setEnvs } = await import("@llamaindex/env");
    setEnvs(env);
    const { OpenAIAgent } = await import("@llamaindex/openai");
    // Start your code here
    return new Response("Hello, world!");
  },
};
```

Then, you need create `.dev.vars` and add LLM api keys for the local development, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI API key.

<Callout type="warn">Do not commit the api key to git repository.</Callout>

## Difference between Node.js and Cloudflare Worker

In Cloudflare Worker and similar serverless JS environment, you need to be aware of the following differences:

- Some Node.js modules are not available in Cloudflare Worker, such as `node:fs`, `node:child_process`, `node:cluster`...
- You are recommend to design your code using network request, such as use `fetch` API to communicate with database, insteadof a long-running process in Node.js.
- Some of LlamaIndex.TS modules are not available in Cloudflare Worker, for example `SimpleDirectoryReader` (requires `node:fs`), Some multimodal API that relies on [`onnxruntime-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onnxruntime-node)(we might port to HTTP based module in the future).
- `@llamaindex/core` is designed to work in all JavaScript environment, including Cloudflare Worker. If you find any issue, please report to us.
- `@llamaindex/env` is a JS environment binding module, which polyfill some Node.js/Modern Web API (for example, we have a memory based `fs` module, and Crypto API polyfill). It is designed to work in all JavaScript environment, including Cloudflare Worker.
