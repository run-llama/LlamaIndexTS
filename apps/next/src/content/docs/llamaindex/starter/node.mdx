## Adding environment variables

By default, LlamaIndex uses OpenAI provider, which requires an API key. You can set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with OpenAI.

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Or you can use a `.env` file:

```shell
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key" > .env
node --env-file .env your-script.js
```

<Callout type="warn">Do not commit the api key to git repository.</Callout>

For more information, see the [How to read environment variables from Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs).

## TypeScript support

LlamaIndex.TS is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions.
We recommend using [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) to run TypeScript scripts.

```shell
npx tsx my-script.ts
# or
node --import tsx my-script.ts
```
