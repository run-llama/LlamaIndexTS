Before you start, make sure you have try LlamaIndex.TS in Node.js to make sure you understand the basics.

## Differences between Node.js and Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that has both server side compatibility and client side compatibility.
This means that you need to be careful when using LlamaIndex.TS in Next.js.
Don't leak the import data like API keys to the client side.

Also, in Next.js, there is build time and runtime. Some computations can be done at build time like Document embedding could be done at build time for better performance.
LlamaIndex.TS has lots of upstream dependencies, some of them are not compatible with Next.js.

You might need to use `withNext` to make sure that LlamaIndex.TS works well with Next.js.

```js
// next.config.mjs / next.config.ts
import withLlamaIndex from "llamaindex/next";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

export default withLlamaIndex(nextConfig);
```

If you see any dependency issues, you are welcome to open an issue on the GitHub.
