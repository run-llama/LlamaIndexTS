   * Dear reader of this message. Please take this seriously.
   *
   * If you see this message, make sure that you only import one version of llamaindex. In many cases,
   * your package manager installs two versions of llamaindex that are used by different packages within your project.
   * Another reason for this message is that some parts of your project use the CJS version of llamaindex
   * and others use the ESM version of llamaindex.
   *
   * This often leads to issues that are hard to debug. We often need to perform constructor checks,
   * e.g. `node instanceof TextNode`. If you imported different versions of llamaindex, it is impossible for us to
   * do the constructor checks anymore - which might break the functionality of your application.
