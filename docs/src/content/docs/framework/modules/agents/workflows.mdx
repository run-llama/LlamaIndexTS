title: Workflows
---

A `Workflow` in LlamaIndex is a lightweight, event-driven abstraction used to chain together several events. Workflows are made up of `handlers`, with each one responsible for processing specific event types and emitting new events.

Workflows are designed to be flexible and can be used to build agents, RAG flows, extraction flows, or anything else you want to implement.

To use workflows install this package:

```package-install
npm i @llamaindex/workflow-core
```

This contains the core functionality for the workflow system. You can read more about the core concepts in the [workflow-core](/typescript/workflows/) section.

In contrast, the `@llamaindex/workflow` package contains more utiltities, such as prebuilt agents.

```package-install
npm i @llamaindex/workflow
```
